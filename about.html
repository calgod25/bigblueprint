    <h1>Who is Cal</h1>
  </header>

  <div class="content">
    <p>Calvin Godfrey is a USA-Palestinian professional basketball player and proven big man with over a decade of experience playing overseas. Known for his tenacity and versatility as a power forward, Cal has competed across Europe and the Middle East, leaving his mark on every team he’s played for.</p>

    <p>He’s dedicated his post-playing career to building the next generation of bigs—those who don’t always fit the mold, but who can dominate when given the right tools. From personal experience growing up without position-specific training, Cal created The BIG Blueprint to give young bigs and tweeners the roadmap he never had.</p>

    <p>This platform is the result of years of in-game learning, gritty off-court self-development, and a commitment to helping others break through. Whether you’re a future rim protector or a hybrid forward with bounce and brains—Cal's blueprint was made for you.</p>
