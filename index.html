    <h1>Welcome to The BIG Blueprint</h1>
    <p>Created for the often-overlooked bigs — power forwards, centers, and tweeners who need dedicated, fundamental training to elevate their game and get seen.</p>
  </div>
  <div class="section">
    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>I was a scrawny, taller-than-average kid who never quite fit into the traditional training mold. I tagged along in workouts meant for guards or wings, but knew I’d one day be a forward or center. So I trained myself — parks, gyms, whatever it took to polish the skills I needed. The BIG Blueprint is the program I wish I had growing up. Built for you.</p>

    <h2>Our Mission</h2>
    <p>To give young bigs the training, tools, and clarity they need to succeed in today’s evolving game. While the NBA is more dynamic than ever, one thing stays the same — being elite in your role matters. Let’s define it together.</p>

    <h2>Why I’m Here for You</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Position-specific drills and IQ</li>
      <li>Confidence through repetition</li>
      <li>Adaptability for modern basketball</li>
      <li>Insight from a pro who’s lived it</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Is This for You?</h2>
    <p>If you're a tall kid who’s always played “everywhere,” this is your lane. If you’ve been told to just run the floor, set screens, or stand in the paint — and you want more — you’re in the right place. This is for the kids and families who want to define their role, refine their tools, and elevate their chances of being seen. </p>
