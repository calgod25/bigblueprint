    <h1>The BIG Blueprint</h1>
    <p>A campaign crafted for the growth of BIGS — because your position matters.</p>
  </header>

  <!-- MY STORY -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <p>I grew up as a scrawny kid who just happened to be taller than everyone around me. I was constantly tossed into random training sessions because of my athleticism, but none of them were tailored to the position I would actually play: Power Forward or Center. That meant I had to spend years on my own, grinding in gyms and parks, building up the skillset I needed to thrive in the paint — learning from trial, error, and passion. This is the blueprint I wish I had back then.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- MISSION -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Mission</h2>
    <p>The BIG Blueprint is here to solve a gap in basketball development: training for bigs. Our mission is to provide a clear foundation for Power Forwards and Centers — the footwork, awareness, defense, and finishing skills that define impact in the paint. We believe that polishing your positional game is the clearest path to being seen, evaluated, and respected at the next level.</p>
  </div>

  <!-- PILLARS -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Why I'm Here for You</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>Because bigs deserve their own lane in training — not just guard work repurposed</li>
      <li>Because tweeners need direction, not confusion</li>
      <li>Because proper fundamentals will outlast trends</li>
      <li>Because when you know your role, you stand out</li>
    </ul>
  </div>

  <!-- IS THIS FOR YOU -->
  <div class="section">
    <h2>Is This for You?</h2>
    <p>Ask yourself:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>Are you the tallest on your team — and still feel overlooked?</li>
      <li>Do your coaches work more with guards than with bigs?</li>
      <li>Have you been stuck between positions — unsure where you fit?</li>
      <li>Do you want to learn how to be elite in YOUR zone?</li>
    </ul>
    <p>If that sounds like you or your child, then YES — you're in the right place.</p>
